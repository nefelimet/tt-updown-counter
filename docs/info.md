## How it works

A 3-bit up/down counter with a rst signal, enable signal, load signal, and up/down signal.

When the rst is low, the output is set to 0.
When the load_cnt signal is low, the input data is assigned to the output.
When count_enb is high, counting happens at every positive edge of the clock. updn_cnt controls whether the counter counts up or down.

## How to test

Set signals and see waveforms accordingly.
